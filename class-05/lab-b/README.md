# Lab 05b: Finish the "About Me" project

Put finishing touches on your About Me web site. Make sure your final app meets all of the requirements for this project. Get it deployed via GitHub Pages. 

The more time you spend with this, the better you'll get at CSS.

## Setup and Documentation

Continue working in the same repository as the other labs for the "About Me" project.

## User Stories and Feature Tasks

There are no additional user stories or feature tasks. This is a good time to review all of the user stories and feature tasks from the prior labs and ensure that they have all been met.

Consider doing some user testing: Ask a few classmates to play your guessing game and view your About Me page and offer feedback. They will see things that you have not.

### Stretch Goals

1. Using [this article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/04/web-developer-guide-color/) as a reference, develop and apply a new color palette to your page.

1. You've built a static website, now to deploy your site to an S3 bucket. Seek the necessary documentation and deploy your "About Me" project via S3.

## Getting Started

Consider making a checklist of items to review, including, but not limited to:

- User stories
