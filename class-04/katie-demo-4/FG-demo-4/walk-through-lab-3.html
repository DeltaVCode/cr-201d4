  /*- As a developer, I want to add a sixth question to my guessing game that takes NUMERIC INPUT  by prompting a user to guess a number (for instance, "What is my favorite number?" or "How many PokÃ©mon did I catch this week?"), and indicates to the user whether the guess is "too high" or "too low", and gives the user exactly four opportunities to get the correct answer, so that my fancy programming skills are showcased.
- As a developer, I want to add a seventh question to my guessing game that has multiple possible correct answers that are stored in an array (for instance, "Can you guess a state that I have lived in besides Washington?"), so that even more of my programming skills are showcased. For now, I will structure this question so that the user has six tries to get a single correct answer, and upon using up those tries OR getting a correct answer, displays a messcaughtPokemon to the user indicating all of the possible correct answers.
- As a developer, I want to keep a tally of the total number of correct answers given by the user, and at the end of the game, tell the user how well they did with a personalized custom messcaughtPokemon that includes the number of correct answers and also addresses the user by name, e.g. "You got 4 out of 7 questions correct, Bobbi! Better luck next time." */
